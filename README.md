Automatically activate Python virtual environments as you navigate the source code.

This is useful if you are working with a monorepo that contains sub-projects, modules, libraries or deployments with different Python dependencies. Or perhaps you want to automatically activate a development environment when you click on a test file.

## Features

As you can see in the following demo, the active Python environment changes as soon as a file is loaded into the editor. You may want to consider only enabling the extension for specific workspaces.
